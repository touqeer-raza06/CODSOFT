## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 🔹 [Task 1 – Titanic Survival Prediction](./Task%201%20-%20Titanic%20Survival%20Prediction)
- Built a classification model using Random Forest to predict passenger survival on the Titanic.
- Explored data preprocessing, handled missing values, and evaluated the model using accuracy and confusion matrix.

### 🔹 [Task 2 – Movie Rating Prediction](./Task%202%20-%20Movie%20Rating%20Prediction)
- Implemented a regression model to predict IMDb movie ratings based on genres, votes, duration, and year.
- Cleaned messy data, processed multiple genres using MultiLabelBinarizer, and evaluated performance using R² score and error metrics.

### 🔹 [Task 3 – Iris Flower Classification](./Task%203%20-%20Iris%20Flower%20Classification)
- Developed a multi-class classification model to identify iris species using petal and sepal features.
- Used Random Forest Classifier with high accuracy and tested on clean, balanced data.

### 🔹 [Task 4 – Sales Prediction Using Python](./Task%204%20-%20Sales%20Prediction%20Using%20Python)
- Created a regression model to forecast product sales based on advertising spend (TV, Radio, Newspaper).
- Trained using RandomForestRegressor and evaluated using R² Score, MSE, and MAE.

### 🔹 [Task 5 – Credit Card Fraud Detection](./Task%205%20-%20Credit%20Card%20Fraud%20Detection)
- Built a binary classification model to detect fraudulent transactions from anonymised credit card data.
- Handled class imbalance using SMOTE, scaled relevant features, and evaluated with precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
