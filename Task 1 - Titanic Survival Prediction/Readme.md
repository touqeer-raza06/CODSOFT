# 🚢 Task 1 - Titanic Survival Prediction

This project is part of the CodSoft Data Science Internship. The objective is to develop a machine learning model that predicts the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic, based on features such as age, sex, class, and others.

---

## 📌 Objective

To predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using supervised learning techniques (classification).

---

## 📂 Dataset

- The dataset contains information about the passengers on the Titanic.
- Key features include:
  - `Pclass`: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
  - `Sex`: Gender
  - `Age`: Age in years
  - `SibSp`: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
  - `Parch`: Number of parents/children aboard
  - `Fare`: Ticket fare
  - `Embarked`: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

---

## 🧠 Model Used

- **Random Forest Classifier**
  - Chosen for its robustness and ability to handle missing/non-linear data.
  - Evaluated using accuracy score on the test set.

---

## 📊 Results

- **Accuracy Score:** ~ 80%
- Model shows good performance on test data using selected features.
